	x Take sensor data once more so that remaining issue with sensor 1 is resolved.	- not resolved
	X Set crucially the servo limits in which the car is comfortable.	
	X Calculate the min radius in which the car can take a turn, by setting the extreme limits.

14-aug-2010
	X To correct the logic of position calculation, in project2
	X Add limit overflow algorithm to combat the overflow of iterm.
	x Vedios of PID tuning of line follower on you tube.
	x Study about Ni-Cd battery.
	x assesment of the new data taken as observations.
	x Interrupts for ATD conversion.	-	28-aug-2010
	* Recalibration of the sensors and properly get the position data, errors, etc.
	* Correct calculation of ATD conversion time of both 8bit and 16bit resolution.
	x Read the sensor datasheet

16-aug-2010
	x Write  a program that can automatically log data in excel, so we can create graphs, find min, max..

19-aug-2010
	x email prof about the track details, so that we can make a similar track and test properly the car
	* frequencyof MCU'
	x Try to maximize the speed of algorithm at all costs.
	x Make the data logger application log compensated values as well.. ******

26-aug-2010
	*  PLL clock to read from datasheet
	* Sleep modes from datasheet
	* eeprom or flash from datasheet
	* compiler optimisation and generating compact code

27-aug-2010
	x To see if changing the Sample time of ADC has some effect in th ATD readings..

31-aug-2010
	* Study the pulse accumulator.
	* Study the EEPROM to save the values of kp and ki.
4-sep-2010
	*WHY do we need PWM on both sides of the MOTOR?? 

10-sep-2010
	* Recompensation of sensors
	* Tuning the kp and ki values.
	* Use of shaft encoder to stablize the speed ... ********IMP********

	* Removal is  of floating point and use of fixed point..
