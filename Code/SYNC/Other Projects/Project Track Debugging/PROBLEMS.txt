Track overrun at the edges of the track

          1. May be sampling can overcome the problem, so learn interrupts as soon as possible...
          2 May be on the final track the car will not overrun the track.
          3. Develop a trackover run algorithm and modify the position calculation algorithm.
          
          4. Change the entire algorithm and replace with a different algorithm to find the error..
          
          
 Solution
   looking at the values of sensors from the final track traversal data,
          
          On white, sensor values may vary from place to place, but it is very essential requirement of the algorithm that at white,
          all values of sensors should be alsolutely 0. This is particularly the case of 0th sensor.
          
          The caliberation of the all sensor has to be done so that values at any position os decreasing in both directions. This is 
          also the case of 0th sensor..
