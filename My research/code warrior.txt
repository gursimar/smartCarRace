I HAVE THE SOLUTION !!!!!

I have CW 6.1 working on Windows7 x64 bit version.

Just do the following steps:

 

1) Install the p&e drivers version 10 from:

http://www.pemicro.com/blog/post.cfm/p-e-hardware-?interface-drivers-version-10-windows-7

This includes drivers for all windows versions and windows 7 x86 and x64 too !!!

2) Copy from win32 intalled CodeWarrior (like xp 32bits) from Program Files\Frescale\CodeWarrior for Microcontrollers V6.1 to the c:\Program Files(x86)\Freescale\CodeWarrior for Microcontrollers V6.1

3) Now, this step is the MOST IMPORTANT:

    Look at the file "Mwregsvr.exe" in the c:\Program Files(x86)\Freescale\CodeWarrior for Microcontrollers V6.1\bin and click the right button on this file, then click in properties.

    Now, in compatibility tab,set the compatibility in WindowsXp (sp2) and set the checkbox

    to run in administrator mode.

    Now, click in aply button then click in OK(accept) button.

4) In the same folder, run once the file regservers.bat

    When the windows ask for the permisions, just click yes everytime.

 

Now, the CW is running on Windows7 x64 !!!!

 

Jus try with CW 6.2 and 6.3 and tell me !!!
